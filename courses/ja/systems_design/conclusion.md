# Conclusion

Armed with these principles, we hope the course will give a fresh perspective to design software systems. It might be over-engineering to get all this on day zero. But some are really important from day 0 like eliminating single points of failure, making scalable services by just increasing replicas. As a bottleneck is reached, we can split code by services, shard data to scale. As the organization matures, bringing in [chaos engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_engineering) to measure how systems react to failure will help in designing robust software systems.
