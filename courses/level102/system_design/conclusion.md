We have looked at designing a sytem from the scratch, scaling it up from a single server to multiple datacenters and hundreds of thousands of users. However, you might have (rightly!) guessed that there is a lot more to system design than what we have covered so far. This course should give you a sweeping glance at the things that are fundamental to any system design process. Specific solutions implemented, frameworks and orchestration systems used evolve rapidly. However, the guiding principles remain the same. We hope you this course helped in getting you started along the right direction and that you have fun designing systems and solving interesting problems.
